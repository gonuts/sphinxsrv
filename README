SphinxSrv is the daemon that serves the Sphinx documentation at
http://protocol.mumbleapp.com.

Its /hook handler is hooked up as a webhook the github.com/mumble-voip/mumble-protocol
repo. When a new commit is pushed, sphinxsrv automatically builds it and deploys it
for serving.

All branches in the target repository are served at subdirectories. Say that the
mumble-protocol repository had a 1.2.4 branch containing documentation for the 1.2.4
version of the Mumble protocol. When commits are pushed to that branch, sphinxsrv
makes the resulting Sphinx HTML documentation available at /1.2.4.  The master branch
is always served at /.
